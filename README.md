# StegImageUI

Wpf application for image steganography.

It is possible to embed text or a document in an image depending on image size.
It works on the LSB or the two LSBs.
Supported formats are:
BMP
GIF
JPG
PNG
TIF

Having more time I would like to fix some issues and add improvements.

For the time being just take it or leave it.

Enjoy :-)
